* getting new RSS items
* getting starred RSS items
* setting read marker for item(s)
* setting starred marker for item(s)
* hot links

## <a name="downloads">Downloads</a>
Like Tiny Tiny RSS, the Fever API plugin is a rolling release model and there are no periodic updates. You should use git to clone the repository to install the plugin. If you must manually download a snapshot of the master branch, you can click the [`Download ZIP`](https://github.com/DigitalDJ/tinytinyrss-fever-plugin/archive/master.zip) button.

## <a name="supported">Supported / Tested Clients</a>

These clients should work with Fever API emulation.

* [Reeder](http://reederapp.com) - iPhone
* [Mr.Reader](https://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/index.html) - iPad
* [ReadKit](http://readkitapp.com) - OS X
* [Press](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twentyfivesquares.press) - Android
* [Meltdown](https://github.com/phubbard/Meltdown) - Android
  * displays feeds as 'orphan' items, but runs fine

## <a name="installation">Installation</a>

**IMPORTANT** You must enable the option `Enable API access` in your Tiny Tiny RSS preferences, for every user that wants to use the Fever plugin.

Clone this repository to your `plugins.local` folder of your Tiny Tiny RSS installation.

```
$ cd tt-rss/plugins.local
$ git clone https://github.com/DigitalDJ/tinytinyrss-fever-plugin fever
```

Enable the `fever` plugin in the Tiny Tiny RSS Preferences and reload.

A `Fever Emulation` accordion pane should appear in your Tiny Tiny RSS preferences that will allow you to set a password for the Fever API. This is the password you will use to login to your Fever client, and should be different to your Tiny Tiny RSS login password.

**IMPORTANT** The Fever API uses insecure unsalted MD5 hash. You should choose a disposable application-specific password and consider the use of HTTPS with your Tiny Tiny RSS installation. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is an excellent resource to setup free SSL certificates for your HTTP server.

Once the password is saved, you may login to your Fever client using your Tiny Tiny RSS username, the password you set in the previous step and the following server / endpoint URL:

```
https://example.com/tt-rss/plugins.local/fever/
```

See the [archived forum post](https://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=1981) for more detailed and outdated information.

## <a name="upgrading">Upgrading</a>

Upgrading the Fever plugin follows the same steps as your Tiny Tiny RSS installation:

```
$ cd tt-rss/plugins.local
$ git pull origin master
```

## <a name="debug">Debugging</a>

In the file ```fever_api.php``` there are two flags for debugging at the beginning of the file.

* ```DEBUG``` - set this to `TRUE` to produce extra debugging output. The location of the log is dependent on your PHP `log_errors` and `error_log` configuration directives.
* ```DEBUG_USER``` - set this to the ID (from `ttrss_users`  database table) of your user you would like to force authenticate with. The authentication process is then skipped and the API is always authenticated using this ID.

## <a name="error">Error Reporting</a>

If you have problems with authentication after updating the plugin, try to re-enter the password in Tiny Tiny RSS Fever plugin and save it again.

If you encounter any defects please [create an issue](https://github.com/DigitalDJ/tinytinyrss-fever-plugin/issues/new) on GitHub.

Please include any debug logs and any output from the Tiny Tiny RSS `Error Log` (located in Preferences > System).

**IMPORTANT** Ensure logs are sanitized by removing any usernames, passwords and API keys.

Also specify versions and variants of the software you are using:
* Tiny Tiny RSS commit
* PHP (and integration with your HTTP server, e.g. php-fpm)
* Operating System (e.g. FreeBSD, Debian)
* HTTP Server (e.g. Apache, nginx)
* Database Server (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)
